This calculator app was a project made to continue devvloping my skills in web development and programming in javascript.
I tried to make the calculator interactive with displaying the numbers on screen, well aditionally make the calculator look well designed.
I think my styling skills are improve=ing and hope to continue to get better so my projects can be more responsive.
